### Data for "Efficient Bayesian inference of fully stochastic epidemiological models with applications to COVID-19."
#### Yuting I. Li *et al.*, [arXiv:2010.11783](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11783)

### Overview

This repository contains python code (scripts and jupyter notebooks) for generation and processing of the results of [arXiv:2010.11783](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11783).  Results are obtained using the [PyRoss](https://github.com/rajeshrinet/pyross) library to analyse an epidemiological compartment model for COVID-19 in England and Wales, during March-May 2020.

Running the code requires `PyRoss`.  See <https://github.com/rajeshrinet/pyross> for installation instructions etc.

### Repo contents 
(see [arXiv:2010.11783](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11783) for definitions of terms.)

Folders (subdirectories) for model variants (the names indicate the sources used for *contact matrices*)
* `fumanelli-step` : $`C^F`$ variant, step-like NPI
* `prem-step` : $`C^P`$ variant
* `mix-step` : $`C^M`$ variant
* `fumanelli-ez` : $`C^F`$ variant, NPI-with-easing

#### Notebooks 
In most cases, the notebook "code" is identical in each folder, the results are different because variant 
information is loaded from `expt_params_local.py`.  The only small differences are for the MCMC analysis of the `-ez-` variant, 
when displaying MCMC traces.

To understand PyRoss syntax, see the [ documentation](https://pyross.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [examples](https://github.com/rajeshrinet/pyross#examples)

Notebooks that exist in every folder. 
* ew-inf.ipynb : parameter optimisation for MAP
* ew-mcmc.ipynb : MCMC on posterior
* ew-mcmcPost.ipynb : MCMC post-process
* ew-evidence.ipynb : evidence computation

Notebooks only for `fumanelli-step` and `fumanelli-ez`
* ew-sample.ipynb : stochastic forecasts

Notebooks only for `fumanelli-step`
* ew-FIM.ipynb  : Fisher information matrix

Additional notebooks for `fumanelli-ez`
* ew-tWinNN-inf.ipynb : inference : where NN=09,10,11 is (inference window length + 1)
* ew-tWinNN-mcmc.ipynb : ditto for mcmc
* ew-tWinNN-result_mcmc.ipynb : ditto for mcmc postprocess

#### Data 

Data that exist in each folder
* ewMod-inf.pik : inference result
* ewMod-result_mcmc.pik : representative MCMC samples

(note: the full set of MCMC samples (`ewMod-mcmc.pik`) is *not* provided here due to very large file sizes, but `ewMod-result_mcmc.pik` contains representative samples)

Data only for `fumanelli-step` and `fumanelli-ez`
* ewMod-sample-post.pik : stochastic forecast (posterior sampled params)
* ewMod-sample-map.pik : stochastic forecast (MAP params)

Data only for `fumanelli-step`
* ewMod-FIM.npy : Fisher information matrix (as numpy array)
* ewMod-FIM-evec.pik : spectrum of FIM

Figures are in the folder:
* `finalFigs/` 

which are generated by python scripts
(these also use PyRoss to run deterministic forecasts, etc, they should be run direct from the directories where they live)
* `fumanelli-step/stepFigs.py` : graphs for step-like NPIs and for model comparison
* `fumanelli-ez/easeFigs.py` : graphs for NPI-with-easing
* `fumanelli-ez/genFigs.py` : general figs, NPIs, contact matrices, etc
